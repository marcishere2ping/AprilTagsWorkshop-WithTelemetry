# AprilTagsWorkshop-WithTelemetry
A CCS robotics code (credits to Cobalt Colts)
Hi Everyone, 
  I'm Marcos Gutierrez

This code couldn't have been done without the help of Cobalt Colts and I want to thank them for the explanation on 
the code for April Tags and OpenCV Camera Sensing. As the head coder of our team, we offer this onBotJava script based
code so you can expand in your knowledge of coding and growing out of java Blocks (its getting too easy).
